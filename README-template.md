### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```They're decent and I'm proud of every line
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transform: translate(-50%,-50%)
}
```
```



### Continued development

So I wanna master the skills I've gained from css and html by doing more projects, and challenges, And then I ll try to focus on stuff like responsive design, Mastering Animations and transitions...etc
After that I want to learn Javascript. And link it with HTML and CSS which is I think Called "DOM manipulation"
and after that delve into some frameworks like react and other stuff.
